## Hi there 👋

### 🤺 About Me

<img align="right" width="88" src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45090349?v=4" />

<p>&emsp;&emsp;🔭 I'm currently an undergraduate student majoring in software engineering, working hard to be admitted to Tsinghua, Peking or any other amazing Universities for a master's degree.</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;Hope to pursue a PhD and postdoctoral research at an amazing American university. (Wish I'm good enough for it) </p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;⚡ I love music, film and traveling, and once studied the violin under Zhonghong Sheng(an amazing and famous violin teacher) for 5 years, from whom I understand the importance of focus and perseverance.</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;🤗 Interesting fact: If I had met my violin teacher earlier, I might have majored in violin instead of computer science.</p>

### 🏢 Education Experience

(🤔 waiting to be updated...)

###
Without the support of all of the fantastic teachers or professors or senior students I have met, I would not have been able to achieve these accomplishments. Hope one day I could assist other students in the way they have helped me. Happy New Year for 2025!🎇🎊
