<p>&emsp;&emsp;🔭 I'm currently an undergraduate student majoring in software engineering, working hard to be admitted to any amazing universities for a master's degree.</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;Hope to pursue a PhD and postdoctoral research at an amazing American university. (Wish I'm good enough for it) </p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;⚡ I love music, film and traveling, and once studied the violin under Zhonghong Sheng(an amazing and famous violin teacher) for 5 years, from whom I understand the importance of focus and perseverance.</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;🤗 Interesting fact: If I had met my violin teacher earlier, I might have majored in violin instead of computer science.</p>
